Abstract— Nowadays, Analysis of atmosphere conditions has 
become a vital process; where in prediction of state weather for 
a future time is made based on location. To improve the 
performance of system, collection of data related to current state 
of the atmosphere is important. Further using the understanding 
of atmospheric processes, determine or predict the atmosphere 
of future by applying ML techniques.  
The paper discusses application suitable Data Mining 
techniques, Regression approaches and Artificial Neural 
Network models to predict weather parameters. A study further 
ends by comparing different techniques for weather forecasting. 
The main moto of this study is to compare and identify a precise 
weather forecasting model. Weather prediction will be effective 
if, Input Data of years is taken instead of just 2 -3 days. Thus, if 
we train the system by considering huge data the performance 
will be more effective - “Better the training, better the result”.  
Keywords— Data Mining, Multiple Linear Regression, 
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average, Artificial Neural 
Network. 
I. INTRODUCTION 
The prediction of weather conditions can have 
significant impacts on various sectors of society in different 
parts of the country. Government and industries use the 
forecast data to protect life and property and to improve the 
efficiency of operations. The prime contribution of this paper 
is to compare the existing weather forecasting model and to 
select the precise model based on their predictive ability. The 
methodology consists of two stages for each study period data 
of weather parameters which are (1) Development of 
Predicting models and comparison of their aptitude. (2) 
Identification of precise and reliable weather forecasting 
model. These two components correspond to reducing the 
forecasting errors by relaxing certain assumptions of 
traditional forecasting techniques. Both the components are 
interlinked to each other.

The different techniques used in prediction of weather are [3]:  
1) Synoptic weather prediction: Its’ a traditional approach 
that refers to the observation of different weather elements 
within the specific time of observation. Preparation of a 
meteorological center is done in order to keep track of records 
of atmosphere. Meteorological centers forms series of 
synoptic charts daily, which forms the very basic of weather 
forecasts. It engross vast collection and study of observational 
data obtained from thousands of weather stations.  
2) Numerical weather prediction: [2] It is a sophisticated 
set of computer programs containing mathematical and 
physical equations/algorithms that describe the atmosphere 
and how it will change over time in order to produce 
meteorological forecasts. The Quality of Analysis depends on 
observations made and methods used. Observations related to 
land areas, atmosphere are all vital. If the initial stage of the 
weather is not completely known, the prediction will not be 
entirely accurate.  
3) Statistical weather prediction: [24] It is a branch of 
objective weather forecasting. This prediction is commonly 
based on least square regression procedures.  Statistical 
method use results of numerical models and numerical 
modelers recognize usefulness of properly applied statistical 
procedures. It uses the past records of weather data on the 
assumption that future will be a repetition of past weather. 
The main purpose is to identify the aspects of weather that are 
good indicators of the future events. Only the overall weather 
can be predicted in this way. 
Data mining [4] is a process which finds useful patterns 
from large amount of data. Prediction is the most important 
technique of data mining which employs a set of pre
classified examples to develop a model that can classify the 
data and discover relationship between independent and 
dependent data.  
Multiple Linear Regression is used when there is need to 
predict the value of one variable based on the value of two or 
more variables. An Autoregressive Integrated Moving

Average model predicts a value in a response time series as a 
linear combination of its own past values, past errors and past 
values of other time series. An Artificial Neural Network is a 
powerful data modelling tool that provides a methodology for 
solving many types of non-linear problems that are difficult 
to solve by traditional techniques. The advantage which ANN 
has over other weather forecasting method is that the ANN 
minimizes the error using various algorithms and gives us a 
predicted value which is nearly equal to the actual value. 
II.  LITERATURE SURVEY 
There is a wide applicability of data mining techniques for 
weather prediction. E. G. Petre [5] presented a small 
application of CART decision tree algorithm for weather 
prediction. The data collected is registered over Hong Kong. 
The data is recorded between 2002 and 2005. The data used 
for creating the dataset includes parameters year, month, 
average pressure, relative humidity, clouds quantity, 
precipitation and average temperature. WEKA, open source 
data mining software, is used for the implementation of 
CART decision tree algorithm. The decision tree, results and 
statistical information about the data are used to generate the 
decision model for prediction of weather. The way the data is 
stored about past events is highlighted. The data 
transformation is required according to the decision tree 
algorithm in order to be used by WEKA efficiently for 
weather prediction. In case of multiple regression models 
Goulden (1962) found the relationship between monthly 
average of weather parameters and crop yield using multiple 
regression technique. Ramchandran (1967) made an analysis 
of the normal rainfall of 167 observatory station distributed 
over India and the neighbourhood country, using regression 
equation representing monthly and annually rainfall as a 
linear function of latitude, longitude and elevation above sea 
level. Iqbal et al. (2005) made the study on ARIMA to 
forecast the area and production of wheat in Pakistan. Further, 
suggesting that the scope of higher area and production lies in 
adequate availability of inputs, educating and training the 
farming community, soil conservation and reclamation, and 
especially the supportive government policies regarding 
wheat cultivation in the country. Zhou and Hu (2008) 
proposed a hybrid modelling and forecasting approach based 
on the grey and the Box–Jenkins autoregressive moving 
average (ARMA) models to forecast the gyro drift concluding 
that the hybrid method has a higher forecasting precision to 
the complex problems than the single method. Kal et al. 
(2010) developed a framework to determine the optimal 
inventory policy under the environment that the lead-time 
demand is generated by the ARIMA process. An Artificial 
Neural Network is a powerful data modelling tool that 
provides a methodology for solving many types of non-linear 
problems that are difficult to solve by traditional techniques. 
Neural Network makes very few assumptions as opposed to 
normality assumptions commonly found in statistical methods 
several works has been done and different artificial neural 
networks (ANN) models have been tested. Kaur[4] and 
Maqsood[5] describes a model that predicts the hourly 
temperature, wind speed and relative humidity 24 hour ahead. 
The authors have made a comparison of Multilayer 
Perceptron Networks (MLP), [20, 21] Elman Recurrent 
Neural Network (ERNN), Radial Basis Function Network 
(RBFN) and the Hopfield Model (HFM) and ensembles of 
these networks. MLP was trained by back propagation. The 
authors have suggested one hidden layer and 72 neurons for 
the MLP network and 2 hidden layers with 180 neurons for 
RBFN as the optimal architecture. The log-sigmoid is the 
activation function for the hidden layer unit of MLP network. 
RBFN has the best performance. The work described by 
Sanjay Mathur[8] focuses on maximum and minimum 
temperature forecasting and relative humidity prediction 
using time series analysis. The network model used is a 
Multilayer feed forward ANN with back propagation learning. 
A fully connected, feed forward 3 layer MLP network for 
temperature prediction is also presented by Santhosh Babu [9]. 
The error is said to be "very less". The set of input differs. 
Atmospheric pressure, atmospheric temperature, relative 
humidity, wind velocity and wind direction are chosen. The 
training is done by back propagation. Another short term 
temperature forecasting system is described by Hayati[10]. A 
three layer MLP network with 6 hidden neurons, a sigmoid 
transfer function for the hidden layer and a pure linear 
function for the output layer was found to yield the best 
performance. 
III.  FORECASTING MODELS 
There are various weather forecasting models; 
however few are discussed in this paper. 
A. Data Mining: 
Data mining using clustering is a powerful way to analyze 
data and gives prediction.  
Proposed Algorithm: 
Step-1: Collect data (NO2, O3, CO2, SO2) in every one hour 
and store in the original database. 
Step-2: Using the Convex Hull Technique, after every two 
hours data received is converted into structural data. All 
extreme data are also included. Then store it in the modified 
structural air pollution database. 
Step-3: The database splits into four sub-databases on the 
basis of weather partition. 
Step-4: Apply K-Means clustering of the structural data, 
where initial cluster centers are guessed using well known 
genetic algorithm (GA). 
Step-5: Further, New Data inserted will use K-Means 
clustering. 
Step-6: Finally, find the resulting clusters. 
Step-7: Result obtained in diverse years (max 3-4 years) can 
be predicted by priority based protocol. 
Step-8:  Standard Threshold temperature value ranges can be 
considered to decide the probable weather condition.  
For the models discussed below seven weather 
parameters are considered like Rainfall, maximum 
temperature, minimum temperature, Relative humidity at

7AM, Relative humidity at 2 PM, Pan evaporation, Bright 
sunshine. 
B. Multiple (multivariate) linear regression(MLR):  
This is the most popular technique for forecasting. It is used 
when there is a need to predict the value of one variable based 
on the value of two or more variables. The variable whose 
value is to be predicted is called dependent variable and the 
other variables are called independent variables. The equation 
fitted for weekly weather parameters using Multiple Linear 
Regression uses one parameter as dependent and other six as 
independent. The generalized form is, 
Y =β0 + β1 X 1+ β2 X 2 + ............... + β6 X6 + ε    --- (1) 
where:  
β 0 = Intercept,  
β i = regression coefficient of ith independent parameters, 
( i = 1,2,…, 6),  
ε = error term,  
Xi = ith weather parameter. 
Stepwise Regression analysis is used to predict the 
dependent weather parameter based on six independent 
weather parameters. The process starts with building of a 
simple regression model where extremely correlated one 
independent parameter is incorporated in the company of 
dependent parameter. Process repeats till the initial model 
includes all contributing parameters. 
C. Autoregressive
Model(ARIMA):  
 Integrated 
Moving 
Average 
[Wiki]The ARIMA Models are often referred to as Box
Jenkins models. In ARIMA (p,d,q) modelling, the first step is 
to check if the time series data is stationary or non-stationary. 
If it is non-stationary then it is transformed to stationary time 
series data by applying appropriate degree of differencing by 
selecting suitable value of ‘d’. Further appropriate values of 
‘p’ and ‘q’ are chosen. In the ARIMA model the 
Autoregressive (AR) term indicates that the evolving variable 
of interest is regressed on its own lagged values. The 
Integrated (I) term, indicates that the data values have been 
replaced with the difference between their values and 
previous values. The Moving Average (MA) term, indicates 
that the regression error is actually a linear combination of 
error terms whose values occurred contemporaneously and at 
various times in past.Non-seasonal ARIMA models are 
generally denoted as ARIMA(p,d,q) where parameters p, d, q 
are non-negative integers, ‘p’ is the order of autoregressive 
model, ’d’ is the degree of differencing and ‘q’ is the order of 
moving average of moving model. 
D. Artificial Neural Network Model(ANN):  
Artificial Neural Network provides methodology for solving 
many types of non-linear problems that are difficult to solve 
by traditional techniques. A typical feed forward artificial 
neural Network with back propagation network should have 
at least three layers- an input layer, a hidden layer, and an 
output layer. Appropriate selection of number of hidden 
layers and the number of neurons in each of them needs 
experimentation. The main aim is to create and train a 
network that can predict the individual weather components 
for e.g. maximum temperature, minimum temperature, wind 
speed etc. for a particular station and a particular day given 
the weather for the previous day (target data) and the 
historical 10 year data of that particular day(input data). 
There are many neural network models, but the basic 
structure involves a system of layered, interconnected nodes 
and neurons are presented in figure 4.1. The nodes are 
arranged to form an input layer, with neurons in each hidden 
layer connected to all neurons in neighbouring layers. The 
input layer supplies data to the hidden layer and does not 
contain activation or transfer functions. A typical feed
forward network might use a dot-product activation function 
that, for each neuron Bj ( j = 1, 2, …..,n) in the hidden layer, 
is computed as: 
Bj = ij Ai + w0j A0      ----  (2) 
with input nodes Ai ( i = 1, 2,…., m) and weights Wij 
between nodes Ai and neurons Bj. The bias node (Ao) 
typically has a constant input of 1, with a matching weight 
Woj. A similar calculation is made for each neuron Ck ( k = 1, 
2, …., o) in the output layer (o = 1 for the example in figure 
4.1), using weights Wjk between neurons Bj and Ck ( with 
Wok and Bo for the bias). Each neuron value is subsequently 
passed through a transfer function, which may be linear or 
nonlinear (Zurada, 1992). 
E. Hybrid Model:  
In recent times, the concept of combined model instead of 
single time series model is being prepared for prediction 
purpose. The combination of MLR with ARIMA and MLR 
with ANN is proposed in the present study. The hybrid of 
multiple linear regression with ARIMA and ANN techniques 
to analyse the weekly weather parameters of all the seven 
parameter studied and included in the comparative study to 
identify the best precise weather forecasting model. 
Hybrid Model of Multiple Linear Regression and 
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (MLR_ARIMA) 
[8, 22, 23] The composition of a multiple linear regression 
with autoregressive integrated moving average model is 
proposed to develop a new hybrid model. It is assumed that 
the predictive performance improves by integrating two 
single models. For this purpose the selected significantly 
contributed parameters obtained through stepwise regression 
analysis are used to develop the MLR_ARIMA model and 
their performance is compared with all other models.

Hybrid Model of Multiple Linear Regression and 
Artificial Neural Network (MLR_ANN)  
It has been observed in the current researches that a single 
model may not be sufficient to identify all the characteristics 
of the time series data. The hybrid models decompose a time 
series into linear and non-linear form and prove to be better 
approach in comparison to single model. The hybrid model of 
multiple linear regression with neural network approach is 
proposed to yield more accurate results. Similar to previous 
model, the significantly contributed parameters selected 
through stepwise regression analysis in multiple linear 
regression model are used to develop the hybrid MLR_ANN 
model.

sowing a multilayer perceptron. 
Performance evaluation criteria: Many analytical 
methods have been proposed for the evaluation and inter
comparison of different models, which can be evaluated in 
terms of graphical representation and numerical computations. 
The graphical performance criteria involve:  
A linear scale plot of the predicted and observed weather 
parameters for training and testing data sets for all the models. 
The numerical performance criterion involves:  
Mean error(BIAS), Mean absolute error(MAE), Root mean 
square error(RMSE), Prediction error(PE) and Correlation 
Coefficient(r). 
For the best prediction, the BIAS, MAE and RMSE 
values should be small and PE should be sufficiently small 
i.e., close to 0. But ‘r’ should be found closer to 1 (between 0
1) for indicating better agreement between observed and 
predicted values. The recital of weather forecasting models 
had been evaluated on the basis of Mat lab 7.0.1 version, 
students’ academic SAS version and Microsoft Excel. 
IV. 
COMPARISION OF WEATHER FORECASTING 
MODELS 
The role of statistical techniques for providing 
reliable predictions of weather parameters is considered to be 
most important in the field of metrology all over the world. 
These predictions influence the agricultural as well as the 
industrial strategies. The comparison among the above 
discussed models shows the trend, based on previous years 
but the actual values were fluctuating. The proposed hybrid 
MLR_ANN model was observed as precise model in 
comparison to MLR, ARIMA, ANN and hybrid 
MLR_ARIMA models. In view of the fact that, all the 
prediction models are consistent but the finest model is the 
lone having least mean absolute error and root mean square 
error, prediction error and high correlation coefficient, as 
observed in hybrid MLR_ANN model. It was observed that 
the ANN model is also precise weather forecasting model as 
compared to MLR and ARIMA models which coincides with 
the previous findings. At last, the study reveal that hybrid 
MLR_ANN model maintained can be used as an appropriate 
forecasting interest to estimate the weather parameters. The 
following table shows a comparison of various models 
developed so far for weather forecasting.

V.  CONCLUSION AND FUTURE SCOPE 
 In this research work we took up a study to identify 
the precise and reliable weather forecasting model through 
comparison of several existing and proposed models. The 
study reveals that Hybrid MLR_ANN model is an appropriate 
forecasting interest to estimate the weather parameters, in 
disparity to the multiple linear regression, ARIMA, ANN and 
hybrid MLR_ARIMA models.  
 By being more precise in what is uncertain, the 
forecasts will become more reliable. A collection of models 
can be used instead of just one and by doing so we can better 
cover the uncertainties in the forecast.
