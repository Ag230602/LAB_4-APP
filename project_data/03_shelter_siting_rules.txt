Shelter siting rules for pre-landfall deployment

Shelter placement must balance safety and accessibility. A shelter site is considered suitable when:
1) It is outside the expected storm surge zone and outside the 1-in-100 floodplain if possible.
2) It has road access that remains usable under heavy rain (avoid known washout corridors).
3) It is within reasonable travel distance for vulnerable populations.
4) It has backup power or can be supplied with generators.
5) It is close to medical facilities or can host medical triage.

Typical constraints used in this project:
- Prefer sites at least 10 miles inland from surge-prone coastlines.
- Avoid locations with projected flood depth above 0.3 meters in the worst-case rainfall scenario.
- Prioritize counties with high vulnerability scores, even if the median forecast is slightly lower.

In practice, shelters are selected from a shortlist (schools, community centers, stadiums). The decision-support system ranks candidate sites and explains the reason for each ranking using evidence (risk, access, vulnerability).
