Ambiguous queries and edge cases in emergency planning

Ambiguous queries occur when the user does not specify:
- a time horizon (before vs after landfall),
- a geography (county vs city vs corridor),
- a decision objective (life safety vs economic recovery),
- or a threshold (probability cutoff).

Examples:
- “Where should we deploy help?” (help could mean shelters, medical, or repair crews)
- “Which area is worst?” (worst by wind? flood? vulnerability? recovery time?)

A robust RAG system should respond by:
1) Asking a clarification question, or
2) Providing multiple possible interpretations with evidence, clearly labeled.

For edge-case evaluation, the rubric should require the system to acknowledge ambiguity and avoid over-confident single answers without specifying assumptions.
