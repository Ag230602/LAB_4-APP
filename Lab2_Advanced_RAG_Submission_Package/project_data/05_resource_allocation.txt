Resource allocation strategy under constraints

Emergency resources include shelters, medical units, search-and-rescue teams, and repair crews. Because resources are limited, planners use triage principles: protect life first, then critical infrastructure, then broader community recovery.

A practical allocation strategy:
1) Identify high-risk counties (probability thresholds for wind/flood).
2) Within high-risk counties, rank by vulnerability (children, elderly, low mobility).
3) Reserve a portion of resources for forecast shifts (flex capacity).
4) Place repair crews near likely damage corridors but outside hazard zones.
5) Update allocations each forecast cycle; avoid unnecessary oscillation by using “change thresholds” (e.g., only move a staging site if risk changes by more than 10 percentage points).

The dashboard should explain allocations in plain language: “County A gets 2 shelters because it has high flood probability and high vulnerability.”
