Forecast uncertainty and decision framing

Forecast uncertainty comes from model error, chaotic weather dynamics, and imperfect observations. Instead of a single path, modern systems provide ensembles: many plausible tracks that form a cone of uncertainty. A wider cone means higher uncertainty, not necessarily a stronger storm.

For decision support, the key question is: where could impacts occur with non-trivial probability? A planning threshold might flag a county if the probability of hurricane-force winds is at least 20% or if the probability of 6 inches of rain is at least 30%. These thresholds are policy choices; lowering them increases coverage but can over-allocate scarce resources.

How uncertainty changes decisions:
- When the ensemble spread increases, planners should avoid committing all resources to a single corridor.
- When forecasts shift east or west between cycles, planners should update staging sites but keep redundancy.
- Uncertainty-aware maps should show both median forecast and credible worst-case boundaries.

Good dashboards make uncertainty visible without overwhelming the user. Common methods include shaded probability bands, scenario toggles (best/median/worst), and “what-if” sliders for thresholds.
