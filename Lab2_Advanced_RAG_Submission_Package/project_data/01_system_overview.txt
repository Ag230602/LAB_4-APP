StormVision-3D: Decision-Support Overview

StormVision-3D is designed to help emergency planners act before landfall by combining forecast uncertainty, exposure, and recovery planning into one decision interface. The system does not replace meteorologists; it translates model outputs into operational choices such as where to pre-position shelters, medical units, and repair crews.

Key data inputs include (1) hurricane track and intensity forecasts, (2) rainfall and storm surge indicators, (3) population vulnerability layers, and (4) infrastructure status (roads, hospitals, power grid). Outputs are shown as an interactive 3D map with layers that update as new forecast cycles arrive.

Early-action planning window: 48 hours before expected landfall, decision makers must choose shelter sites and staging locations. Because forecasts are probabilistic, planners need best-case and worst-case views rather than a single “most likely” line.

Definitions used in this project:
- Impact zone: an area where the probability of damaging winds or flooding exceeds a chosen threshold (e.g., 30%).
- Vulnerability score: a combined index reflecting children, elderly, low-income households, and limited mobility.
- Recovery curve: a time series showing the fraction of service restored (e.g., power restored) over days after the event.

Operational constraints:
- Resources are limited and cannot cover every county.
- Shelters must be placed in low-risk locations with road access.
- Communication to the public must be simple and consistent across updates.
