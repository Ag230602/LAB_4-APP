From damage estimates to recovery curves

Recovery modeling converts hazard and infrastructure damage into expected restoration timelines. For example, if wind damage probability is high and power substations are exposed, the expected power outage duration increases. Recovery curves are useful because they communicate not just “how bad,” but “how long.”

A simple recovery curve can be represented as:
- Day 0: percent of service available right after landfall
- Day 1–7: daily restoration fractions
- Day 7+: long-tail restoration for hard-hit areas

Key drivers of slower recovery:
- Widespread treefall and debris blocking roads
- Flooded substations or damaged transmission lines
- Limited repair crews and supply-chain delays
- Access constraints (bridges, washed-out roads)

For decision support, the system highlights counties where recovery is expected to be slow and suggests resource allocation, such as sending additional crews or prioritizing critical facilities (hospitals, shelters, water treatment).
